# apidoc.js Test

- created a js file with a few functions

- created a basic standard documatation comment over the first function

- typed 'apidoc' command on terminal in the project folder

- that created a folder named doc

- each time after some adding of documantation will require the command 'apidoc' for the changed output

- created _apidoc.js file to start tracking the history

- after that just copied and pasted the previous doc sections only and updated the doc newly in the main file

- here's a screenshot until now:
